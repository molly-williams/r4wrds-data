# CES Overview

OEHHA and CalEPA developed CalEnviroScreen to conduct statewide evaluations of community-scale impacts through this screening tool.

## Purpose

 > A core purpose of developing CalEnviroScreen is to characterize **"impacts"** of pollution in communities with respect to factors that are not routinely included in risk assessment. Often, the terms risk and impact are used synonymously, suggesting that they describe the same outcome. However, the term risk means a probability of an injury or loss, while impact in this context refers more broadly to stressors that can affect health and quality of life. While risk assessment suggests a quantitative approach to evaluating injury or loss, impact assessment implies integrating both quantitative factors and those less readily measured or estimated, but that may increase the magnitude of adverse effects.

**The CalEnviroScreen Dataset:**

 - Provide a broad picture of the burdens and vulnerabilities that communities confront from environmental pollutants.
 - Rely on the use of indicators that are measured or estimated and affect the resulting impact score.
 - Analyzes the data and present results at the census tract scale.
 
## Data

The data is available on the website in the following parts:

 - Microsoft Excel spreadsheet: A spreadsheet showing raw data and calculated percentiles for individual indicators and combined CalEnviroScreen scores for individual census tracts with additional demographic information: [ces3results.xlxs](https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/calenviroscreen/document/ces3results.xlsx) (updated June 2018)
 - [A zipped GDB database](https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/calenviroscreen/document/ces3gdb.zip)
 - [A zipped shapefile](https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/calenviroscreen/document/ces3shp.zip)
